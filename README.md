# Mundus
My IT-kariera module 7 (Software development) project. It is built in C# and Gtk# 2.0.

Mundus is a sandbox openworld RPG. You can explore, destroy, create or fight, the world is your oyster.

**Note**: Install [Gtk-Sharp](https://www.mono-project.com/docs/gui/gtksharp/installer-for-net-framework/) to run the executable on _Windows_ and _Linux_ (to run it on Linux, you should use [Mono](https://www.mono-project.com/download/stable/#download-lin)).
