In this branch I will be adding features that are module requirements:
 - Database integration (`MySQL` database ; `Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore`)
 - Unit tests (`NUnit`)
<br>
I won't be integrating these features in official and post-exam versions of the project. Also many things are dependant on my setup, so I won't be supporting an executable.
<br>
So, this branch **won't be pushed to `master` and, after the exam, will be left only for archiving purposes**.
